A lightweight User Management API built using ASP.NET Core Minimal (Functional) APIs, demonstrating:

Activity 1: Basic CRUD with in-memory storage
Activity 2: Validation, consistent error handling, pagination, and concurrency-safety
Activity 3: Custom middleware for error handling, token-based authentication, and request/response logging

This project follows a clean, folder-based structure and uses top‑level statements (no controllers) with custom middleware components for production-style behavior.
